### Latinograd: The Latin American Spanish Winograd Schemas
**Abstract:** In the last decade researchers proposed *The Winograd Schema Challenge*, a natural language comprehension benchmark to test the ability of machines to perform human common sense reasoning. In order to democratize natural language understanding for the Spanish language, we propose Latinograd, an adaptation of the Winograd Schemes which consists of manual translation of the items while taking care of gender and grammatical number. In addition, we perform a statistical analysis to look for co-occurrence of words to measure the quality of our new benchmark and compare with Winograd Schemas in other languages.

### An agent-based model of gentrification in NetLogo
**Abstract:** There is a constant worry about gentrification phenomenon and the effects in social interactions. In this work we study these effects given initial conditions such as high and low income in native and gentry agents. We expect to see a seggregation pattern given a random distribution of livings and the arrival of gentry agents into place.
